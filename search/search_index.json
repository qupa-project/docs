A child function can never outlive it's parent Any function must have ownership over all values it touches through it's entire life time All functions must return a value Declaration All functions must have three main elements Name Signature Return type The combination of a name, and signature must also make any function unique. Hence you cannot have two instances of the same function. All types within a function header must be explicit as they cannot be efficiently infered. Example This function takes no inputs, but outputs one int fn main () : int { // body return 0 ; } This function takes two input ints, but returns no output fn main ( a : int , b : int ) : void { // body return ; } Calling Convensions To be written Lending Values of any type can also be lent to function calls (but only in function calls). This may appear as reusing a value, but instead is actually a contraction of a reassignment. Any value that is lent, is actually parsed forward, then the function returns an extra result which is then reassigned to the same name. Example Here is an example of adding integers not using lending. fn main () { let value = 3 ; value = add ( value , 3 ); println ( value ); // 9 } fn add ( a : int , b : int ) { return a + b ; } Here is an example of adding integers not using lending. fn main () { let value = 3 ; add ( @ value , 3 ); println ( value ); // 9 } fn add ( a : @ int , b : int ) { a = a + b ; } Why using lending? The two examples are the same length. In this example we were using int which is a primative type, hence there is no real advantage. However later when we introduce classes, this method can have minor improvements due to the compiler being able to easily determine more information about the program. When classes are introduced later, the benfits will become more obvious of the reduce code needed, and the increased clarity. When should I use lending? If the primary goal of your function is to alter some value then return it, it is generally better to use lending for any none normal type values. What happens to a name while a value is lent? While a value is lent the name will appear undefined, only once the value has returned will the name be reuseable The below example will not compile as for the second argument is attempting to lend a now undefind value, because a has already been temporarily consumed. consume ( @ a , @ a );","title":"Functions"},{"location":"functions/#functions","text":"There are three main rules applied to functions to ensure the safety of code within Uniview.

Functions are a way of reusing code, and allow for values to be parsed around. All functions must have a name, brackets for arguments and a body. fn doSomething () { print ( \"Hello\" ); } Functions take arguments in a very similar way to reversing a name, however without the let keyword, and using a , instead of a ; at the end of each one. fn add ( a : int , b : int ) {} Functions can also then have a return value which is stated after the brackets, again very similar to reserving a name like before. fn add ( a : int , b : int ) : int { return a + b ; // (1) } This takes the two numbers given, adds them together, then returns them Once a function is defined it can be used indefinitely. let a = add ( 3 , 5 ); // a = 8 let b = add ( 6 , - 3 ); // b = 3 // ... Note When you give a variable to a function it becomes undefined, as you have given the value away - so now the variable refers to nothing. Functions along with structures, traits, implements, and imports are top level statements. Meaning they can be written in the top level of the file. Unlike assignment and declaration which need to be within a function.

Instead of thinking about assigning values to variables, it would be more accurate to say that you're giving a name to a value. You could think about it like naming a car; if you provide a car with a name, it doesn't change anything about the car itself or where it is stored - instead now you just have a way to refer to it. Continuing with this metaphor, it would be confusing for any specific car to have multiple names; hence, it loses any previous name when receiving a new one. let a = Car . New (); //(1) let b = a ; //(2) A new car is created, and the name a now refers to it. a is now undefined, as the value has been handed to b Initally a Car is created, then the compiler knows this value will be referred to as a . Then the value which was previously refered to as a is now being renamed to b - leaving a as an undefined variable. The compiler will now throw an error if a is attempted to be used, as it refers to no value. The transfer of a value between variable names has no compile time affect, unless that name needs to be recomposed into a structure, class, or actor. Note The example above is using a linear type, this means a value is used always once. Hence it can only be used one time, but also cannot be left dangling and must always be consumed.
