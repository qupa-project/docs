A child function can never outlive it's parent Any function must have ownership over all values it touches through it's entire life time All functions must return a value Declaration All functions must have three main elements Name Signature Return type The combination of a name, and signature must also make any function unique. Hence you cannot have two instances of the same function. All types within a function header must be explicit as they cannot be efficiently infered.

This may appear as reusing a value, but instead is actually a contraction of a reassignment. Any value that is lent, is actually parsed forward, then the function returns an extra result which is then reassigned to the same name. Example Here is an example of adding integers not using lending. fn main () { let value = 3 ; value = add ( value , 3 ); println ( value ); // 9 } fn add ( a : int , b : int ) { return a + b ; } Here is an example of adding integers not using lending. fn main () { let value = 3 ; add ( @ value , 3 ); println ( value ); // 9 } fn add ( a : @ int , b : int ) { a = a + b ; } Why using lending? The two examples are the same length. In this example we were using int which is a primative type, hence there is no real advantage. However later when we introduce classes, this method can have minor improvements due to the compiler being able to easily determine more information about the program. When classes are introduced later, the benfits will become more obvious of the reduce code needed, and the increased clarity. When should I use lending? If the primary goal of your function is to alter some value then return it, it is generally better to use lending for any none normal type values. What happens to a name while a value is lent? While a value is lent the name will appear undefined, only once the value has returned will the name be reuseable The below example will not compile as for the second argument is attempting to lend a now undefind value, because a has already been temporarily consumed. consume ( @ a , @ a );","title":"Functions"},{"location":"functions/#functions","text":"There are three main rules applied to functions to ensure the safety of code within Uniview.
